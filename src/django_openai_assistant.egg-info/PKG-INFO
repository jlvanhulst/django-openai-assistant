A Django / Celery scalable OpenAI Assistant Runner.

Assumption: you have Django up and running with Celery. 
(Tested on Redis)

1)
pip install django_openai_assistant

2)
in settings.py
Add 'django_openai_assistant' to your INSTALLED_APPS [] array 

make sure to have OPENAI_API_KEY defined in settings with your OpenAI key
create and apply migrations for django_openai_assistant 

3)
Create a simple Assistant in https://platform.openai.com/assistants
To begin you probably want one with no functions.

Let's say you called it 'Test Assistant'

4)
Use the assistant in your code:


demo.py
'''
ffrom django_openai_assistant.assistant import assistantTask
from celery import shared_task

## Define OPENAI_API_KEY in your settings.py file
## Add 'django_openai_assistant' to your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
## run python manage.py makemigrations django_openai_assistant and then python managey.pymigrate
## create at least one Assistant in https://platform.openai.com/assistants

def testAssistant(request=None):
    # replace <<your appname>> with the name you django app this file is in!
    # replace <<your assistant name>> with the name of the assistant you created in the OpenAI platform
    task = assistantTask(assistantName="<<your assistant name>>", tools= [], completionCall = "<<your appname>>.test:afterRunFunction")
    task.prompt = "Who was Napoleon Bonaparte?"
    task.createRun() ## this will get everything going!

@shared_task(Name="This will be called once the run is complete")
def afterRunFunction(taskID):
### Function is called when run is completed. MUST be annoted as @shared_task!!! 
### start by retrieving the task
    task = assistantTask(run_id = taskID)
    if task.status == 'completed': ## check to make sure it is completed not failed or something else
        print(task.markdownresponse())
    else:
        print('run failed')
